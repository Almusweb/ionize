Ionize is an  Open Source PHP Content Management system created for  webdesigners and developers.
Ionize is a free professional and  natively multilingual  PHP CMS, developed with user experience
in mind. Ionize is dedicated to webdesigners and web agencies to simply make their clients happy,
but also for developers who does not have his hands tied as in other CMS.

The code is rewritten in  Codeigniter 3.0 PHP Framework  and designed for performance but keeping
the previous confortable Ionize  tags for template parsing but from now Ionize will support other
template parser engines like Smarty and Dwoo. Also a bunch of new features will be implemented.
