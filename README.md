# adamos42:
> The cms need a new version, so  as a developer all I can do is coding the new system in Codeigniter3 PHP Framework
and designed for  performance  but keeping the  previous  confortable  Ionize tags for template parsing but from now
Ionize will support other template parser engines like Smarty and Dwoo and I will add lots of modern features.
